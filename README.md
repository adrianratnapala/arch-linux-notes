INSTALLING ARCH LINUX
=====================

Copyright (C) Adrian Ratnapala, 2019.

The [installation guide][archinst] for [Arch Linux][arch] is
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide; that guide
intentionally leaves many choices up to the reader.  This document is about how
to set up Arch the way I, Adrian, like it.
